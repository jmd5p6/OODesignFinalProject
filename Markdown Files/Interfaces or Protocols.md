# Interfaces or Protocols

## What does the language support?

### Objective C 

Objective C uses protocols.

### Swift

Swift uses protocols.

## What abilities does it have?

### Objective C

Equivalent to Java interface. Protocols can include declarations for both instance methods and class methods, as well as properties.

### Swift

A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality.

## How is it used?

### Objective C

They used to declare methods and properties that are independent of any specific class.

### Swift

The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol. In addition to specifying requirements that conforming types must implement, you can extend a protocol to implement some of these requirements or to implement additional functionality that conforming types can take advantage of.

# Language Purpose and Genesis


## Why was the language created?

### Objective C   
Objective-C was popularized by NeXT and there use of it to develop their NeXTSTEP operating system. However it was originally created by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their company Stepstone as a way to add the capabilites of Smalltalk, another programming language, to the backwards compatability of C.  
### Swift  
Swift was originally created by Chris Lattner to have a language that didn't require a pre-processor and was free of C/C++ legacy. When it was picked up by Apple, its purpose transformed into a replacement for Objective-C that would still be able to live side-by-side with Objective-C to ease transition.  
## What problems was the language trying to address?

### Objective C 
Brad Cox saw many benefits in Smalltalk when it was released, but also many drawbacks, mainly having to do with its dependency on Xerox's technology. This is where Objective-C was born. It's goal was to make obejct oriented programming accessible and easily implementable by branching it off of C.   
### Swift  
Swift's goal, after being picked up by Apple, when develop really picked up, was to essentially package the abilities of Objective-C into an easier to read and more understandable language. Objective-C had become almost antiquated and off-putting for new developers. Swift sought to simplify its original goal.  

## Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

### Objective C   
Objective C's goal was to be an extension for both C and Smalltalk, and its creation stemmed from the desire to have the abilities of both languages in one package.  
### Swift  
Swift was originally a reaction to C/C++, aiming to improve on their base while freeing itself from their legacy, although it quickly turned into a replacement for Objective-C with Apple's help.

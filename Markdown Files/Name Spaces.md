# Name Spaces

## How are name spaces implemented?

### Objective C 
Namespaces are not implemented in Objective C

### Swift
Namespaces are not implemented in Swift

## How are name spaces used?

### Objective C 
Because of the lack of namespaces and the way scope is implemented, each class name as to be unique, usually this is done with uppercase abbreviations in the beginning of the class name. This is used to simulate name spaces.
### Swift
Enums and structs in Swift can be used to simulate namespaces. Also the use of access modifiers helps with avoiding name collisions.

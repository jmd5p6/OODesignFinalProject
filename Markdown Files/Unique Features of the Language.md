# Unique Features of the Language

## Does the language have any particularly unique features?

### Objective C

#### Method Swizzling
This is the act of swapping the implementations of two selectors as a program runs. This can be used for introspection, overriding default behavior, and dynamic method loading. Swizzling is replacing the original method with another, and usually calling the original method within the replacement method. 

### Swift

#### Built in support for optionals
By having support for optionals, Swift helps prevent nil pointers and dereferences. Optionals allow for data to be stored as nil (null).

#### No implicit type cast
Any can represent an instance of any type including function types, and AnyObject can represent an instance of any class type
